# Retrospective answering of the following questions:

# How did the project's design evolve over time? This project actually helped me build the skills need to add a database and user login to a website I am working on outside of class.

# Did you choose to use an ORM or raw SQL? Why?

# I choose to use raw SQL so I could continue building that found data. Having this knowledge is universial.

# What future improvements are in store, if any?

# I'm not really sure at the moment - this is still to be continued.
